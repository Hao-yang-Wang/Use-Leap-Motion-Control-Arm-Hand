# Robotic Arm and Hand Tracking Control System

This repository contains three Python scripts for controlling a robotic arm using Leap Motion hand tracking and UDP communication. The system includes:

1. **`arm_control.py`** – Controls the robotic arm based on received position and orientation data.
2. **`hand_angle.py`** – Captures and processes hand movement angles using Leap Motion and sends them via UDP.
3. **`arm_angle.py`** – Tracks hand position and orientation, displaying them in a GUI and transmitting data over UDP.

## Dependencies

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed before running the scripts:

```sh
pip install numpy opencv-python keyboard scipy leap


🚀 How to Run the Project
1️⃣ Start Leap Motion Service
Before running the scripts, ensure the Leap Motion Controller is connected and the Leap Service is running.

2️⃣ Run arm_angle.py (Hand Position Tracker)
This script tracks the right hand’s position and orientation and transmits data via UDP.
